# Lines in this file beginning with a hash # or less than 12 characters
# long are considered comments

# All other lines are considered to contain a 12-byte string of the
# 'short' hash of a Mercurial commit in the x265 repository which is
# known to change outputs. Ordering is important in this list but
# simple, a commit must appear *above* any commits which are ancestors
# of itself. If you always add new lines to the top, this should be
# enforced implicitly.
